# DengueCasesPrediction

The aim of this project is to remark the importance of **Machine Learning in healthcare** by exploiting a regression tasks. In particular, the attention is moved to Dengue Fever diagnosis, and cases forecasting in two cities. Since a lot of missing data were found, a very good data processing pipeline is a strict requirement; then several experiments with several manipulated datasets are inferred, in order to obtain the right data environment to work with. Final project grade: 15/16, exam name "Data Science Lab". Main algorithms exploited:
* SVR
* PCA
* XGBoost
* Random Forest Regressor
